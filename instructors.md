## Instructional cadence
This is a suggested plan for how to run this workshop. Ideas and additions are welcome.

## Windows OS Notes:

On Windows, node installs fine, but global express install often fails.
Since we mainly need express installed globally only for the generator,
you can achieve this by doing
npm install -g express-generator

Git for windows:

### Agenda

* Introduce Galvanize

* Introduce ourselves :  Instructional team introduces themselves and explains a little about why they came to Galvanize and what they bring to the program

* Students introduce themselves:  Students describe who they are, what their exposure to web development AND/OR programming has been up to this point, and why they signed up for the workshop.

*  Questions / Comments :  open the floor for questions

* Prioritizing content:
Take some time to commit to yourself and the students that the information delivered in this workshop will be communicated within context. Some information that you share will be critically  related the fundamentals of what's going on.  Other information is important but background info and less pivotal.  The reason this is important is that this is going to be a fairly large and complex topic that they're being introduced to if they have not done any js or node programming before.... some things like module.exports are fundamental to being able to get the queries.js file to work, where other things like the environmental variables will work even if they don't fully understand how it's working.

* Note taking protocols:   Outline the expectation that they will have some note taking procedure to note the difference (for example a star by big topics.)

*  5 minute break

* Introduce Lesson objectives


* Introduction to Node.js.  Describe what it is, talk briefly about web application servers, javascript, the advantages of Node, etc.

* Installs

* Intro to Git

* Cloning the repo

* Running Hello World

* "Discovery":  Give the students 15 minutes, in pairs, to look through the repo and figure out how to change one thing or alter one thing in the repo.  

* Discussion
